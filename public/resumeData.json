I worked briefly for State government, wearing multiple ‘hats’: creating interactive data visualizations/dashboards, managing GIS web services, ETL scripting, and being a champion for technology and data driven decisions at the agency.  I currently work as a full stack web developer/GIS developer consulting with a myriad of clients from different sectors and architect and implement custom enterprise web and data solutions with a geospatial focus.  I have a passion for front end development, data visualization, and learning new ways to efficiently deliver exciting interactive user experiences.",
